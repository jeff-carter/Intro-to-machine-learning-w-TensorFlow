# udacity-finding-donors

This repo contains files submitted as a project for the Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Udacity Nanodegree.

## Description
In this project, there was a fictitious charity that is going to raise funds by sending out letters to the community asking for donations. Because of the cost of sending mail, the organization wishes to only send mail out to those most likely to donate. Because there is a positive correlation between the income and likeliness to donate, the goal of the project is to predict whether an individual has a higher income (greater than $50,000).

The data used in this project was collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. A supervised machine-learning model is created and trained of this dataset.

## Software library
